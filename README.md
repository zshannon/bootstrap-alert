- Merge $.alert and $.confirm into single function
- Calls to .focus() on other elements should be queued for after dialog is dismissed
- For $.confirm, if user clicks on matte the dialog should not close
- For $.confirm, if user clicks on matte the dialog should shake left-right like OS X modal dialog
